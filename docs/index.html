   <p>The goal of this project is to formalize the main result of the preprint <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03726">‘On a density conjecture about unit fractions’</a> using the <a href="https://leanprover.github.io/">Lean theorem prover</a>, mainly developed at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/">Microsoft Research</a> by <a href="https://leodemoura.github.io/">Leonardo de Moura</a>. This project structure is adapted from the infrastructure created by Patrick Massot for the <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/sphere-eversion">Sphere Eversion project</a>.</p>
   <p>More precisely we will prove that, any dense set of integers contains distinct integers whose reciprocals sum to 1. (This generalises a colouring result of Croot, and resolves an old open problem of Erdős and Graham.) For further details, precise statements, context, and so on, we refer to the preprint itself.</p>
   <h3 id="exploring-and-helping">Exploring and helping</h3>
   <p>The best way to get started is to read the blueprint introduction, either in <a href="blueprint.pdf">pdf</a> or <a href="blueprint/sect0001.html">online</a>. Then have a look at the <a href="blueprint/dep_graph.html">dependency graph</a>, paying special attention to blue items. Blue items are items that are ready to be formalized because their dependencies are formalized. For lemmas, a blue border means the statement is ready for formalization, and a blue background means the proof is ready for formalization.</p>
